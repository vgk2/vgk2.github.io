#  I am Venu Gopal Kakarla. #

Hi, my name is **Venu Gopal Kakarla** and I am a **Network and Systems Administrator** with equal parts interest in **Networks**, **Systems**, and **Security**.

I administer servers and maintain systems that are optimised for performance, highly available, scalalble, and meet strategic information technology requirements. I am also no slouch at writing documentation, leading training, and providing ongoing support. My clients and co-workers will vouch that I play well with others too.

I graduated from the **Rochester Institute of Technology**â€™s Golisano College of **Computing and Information Sciences** with a **Master of Science** degree in **Networking and Systems Administration** along with an **Advanced Graduate Certificate** in **Information Assurance**. 

Prior to that, I graduated from the **Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani** with a **Bachelors of Engineering** honours degree in **Computer Science**. 

I am currently living in the **United States of America**. Previously I have lived in **United Arab Emirates**, **Republic of Cyprus** and **Republic of India**.

I am also interested in staying physically fit and eating well. I also really enjoy living in the United States of America.

This website and weblog is my personal web presence.
